# Brain_Tumor_CNN_Model
 This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying brain tumor images from MRI scans. The goal of this project is to automatically detect and classify brain tumors into various categories using deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs with TensorFlow and Keras
